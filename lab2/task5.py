#5 Look at lab2-plot.py and create your own script which takes a number as an input and plots the same 3D wave but with different characteristics
# it's totally up to your imagination how do you want to amend the figure according to the input number (1p)

a = float(input("Insert a number: "))
exec(open("lab2-plot.py").read())
